Explanation for Additional Elements:

Firewalls (1, 2, 3):

Firewall 1: Protects the entire infrastructure from unauthorized external access.
Firewall 2 & 3: Provide additional security layers for the load balancer and the individual servers.
SSL Certificate (HTTPS):

Installed on the load balancer to secure data transmission between clients and servers.
Monitoring Clients (Sumo Logic, etc.):

Collect data from various components to monitor system health, performance, and security.
Firewalls:

Added to control and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic.
HTTPS Traffic:

HTTPS ensures encrypted communication, safeguarding data during transmission.
Monitoring:

Used to track system performance, detect issues, and maintain operational health.
Monitoring Clients: Collect performance and security data from servers.
Monitoring Data Collection:

Monitoring clients gather data through agents installed on servers.
Agents transmit relevant metrics (CPU usage, memory, network traffic) to the monitoring service.
Monitoring Web Server QPS:

To monitor Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second), set up monitoring agents to track incoming HTTP requests. Collect and analyze this data over time.
Issues:

Terminating SSL at Load Balancer:

This prevents end-to-end encryption between the load balancer and application servers.
Single MySQL Server for Writes:

Creates a single point of failure for write operations.
Identical Components on Servers:

Uniformity might lead to identical vulnerabilities across the infrastructure.
