1. **Server 1 (Web & App):**
   - Web Server (Nginx): Handles HTTP requests and serves static files.
   - Application Server: Processes dynamic content and user requests.

2. **Server 2 (App & DB):**
   - Application Server: Works alongside the first server for load balancing.
   - Load Balancer (HAProxy): Distributes incoming traffic across the two application servers.
   - Application Files (Code Base): Contains the application code.

3. **Database (MySQL):**
   - Hosts the application's data.

**Explanation for Additional Elements:**

1. **Two Servers:**
   - Enhances redundancy and performance by distributing tasks across multiple machines.
  
2. **Load Balancer (HAProxy):**
   - Distributes incoming traffic evenly between the two application servers, preventing overload on a single server.
  
3. **Application Files (Code Base):**
   - Houses the application's code, shared between the application servers.

**Load Balancer Configuration:**
- **Distribution Algorithm:** Round Robin
   - Allocates requests in a rotating manner among the available application servers.

- **Active-Active Setup:**
   - Both application servers are active, sharing the incoming load.

**Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster:**
- **Primary Node:**
   - Receives write operations from the application.
  
- **Replica Node:**
   - Replicates data from the primary node.
   - Handles read operations to distribute the database load.
  
**Difference Between Primary and Replica:**
- **Primary Node:**
   - Accepts write operations.
   - Responsible for data modification.
  
- **Replica Node:**
   - Supports read operations.
   - Provides data redundancy and availability.

**Issues:**

1. **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
   - No mitigation has been implemented for potential server or component failures.

2. **Security Issues:**
   - No firewall is mentioned, leaving the infrastructure vulnerable.
   - HTTPS (SSL/TLS) is not specified, compromising data security during transmission.

3. **No Monitoring:**
   - Lack of monitoring tools and processes makes it challenging to identify and resolve issues promptly.

To improve this infrastructure, consider implementing redundancy measures, securing the system with firewalls and HTTPS, and integrating monitoring tools for effective management and early issue detection.
